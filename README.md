Kafka is an  
 Open source  
 Distributed  
 Partitioned  
 Replicated  
 Commit-log-based  
 publish-subscribe messaging system.  
 A filesystem or database commit log is designed to provide a durable record of all transactions so that they can be replayed to consistently build the state of a system

data within Kafka is stored durably, in order, and can be read deterministically. In addition, the data can be distributed within the system to provide additional protections against failures, as well as significant opportunities for scaling performance.
